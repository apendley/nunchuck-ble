# nunchuck-ble
Arduino Firmware (PlatformIO) for a BLE Adapter for the Wii Nunchuck accessory.

The main purpose of the Nunchuck BLE adapter is to control custom firmware for the Adafruit LED Glasses Starter Kit (https://www.adafruit.com/product/5255). It might or might not accidentally work with other things.

Information about how to build the adapter can be found at https://adafruit-playground.com/u/squid_jpg/pages/wii-nunchuck-ble-adapter, and 3D printing files can be found at https://www.printables.com/model/981679-wii-nunchuck-ble-adapter.
